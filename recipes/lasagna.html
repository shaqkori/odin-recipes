    <p> Instructions: </p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce </strong>:

            In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
            Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 3-5 minutes.
            Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
            Add the ground beef and Italian sausage, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until browned and no longer pink.
            Drain any excess fat from the meat.
            Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, black pepper, and red wine (if using). Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasoning to taste. </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Filling </strong>:

            In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until smooth and creamy. </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna</strong>:

            Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
            In a 9x13-inch (23x33cm) baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce to prevent sticking.Place 4 cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.
            Spread about one-third of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.
            Sprinkle with one-third of the shredded mozzarella cheese.
            Repeat these layers twice more, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and mozzarella cheese on top. </li>
        <li> <strong>Bake the Lasagna </strong>:

            Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it doesn't touch the cheese to prevent sticking.
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional </li>
        <li><strong> Let it Rest:</strong>

            Allow the lasagna to rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This helps it set and makes it easier to cut.</li>
